function [cycle] = driveCycleParam(cycleName)
%% Description:
% This script creates a synthetic cycle representing a speed profile over
% time. The cycle has been made synthetic so that the speed does not vary
% too often over the cycle and the model simulates faster. There are three
% possible cycle implemented: 
% - Highway with Charging Stops: Long duration High speed cycle with charging stop. 
% - UDDS:                        Short city cycle, no charging
% - HWFET:                       Short highway cycle, no charging

%% Inputs:
% cycleName: [1x1 string] Contains the name of the desired cycle

%% Output: 
% cycle: [1x1 struct] Contains the speed over time profile. The 1st represents the time and the 2nd the velocity
